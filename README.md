Adobe AIR based file inspector. It can read in Flash Shared Objects, JPEGs and Chrome Extensions. After loading, it will show the actually bytes of the file, but as you hover over the bytes it will explain what each section it. This makes it easy to view what makes up each file. Unfortunately it can only open files about 1MiB in size before crashing.
